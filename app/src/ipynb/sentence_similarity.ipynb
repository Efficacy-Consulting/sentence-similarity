The month of fasting and prayer for Muslims gets   under way in many countries on Saturday. \\u2019 \\u2019   When asked by Reuters to comment on Tillerson declining a request   to host an Eid   event in July for Ramadan, a State   Department spokesperson said: \\u2019 \\u2019   \\u201dWe are still exploring possible options for observance of Eid     which marks the end of the month of Ramadan. US   ambassadors are encouraged to celebrate Ramadan through a variety   of activities, which are held annually at missions around the   world.\\u201d \\u2019 \\u201d   Muslim activists have accused President Donald Trump\\u2019s   administration of having an unfriendly attitude toward Islam,   encapsulated by its attempts to ban citizens of several     countries from entering the United States. \\u201d \\u201d   The administration says that while it strongly opposes Islamist   militants, it has no quarrel with Islam. Aides point to Trump\\u2019s   visit this month to Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam where   he addressed the leaders of more than 50 Muslim countries, as   evidence of that. \\u201d \\u201d   Members of Congress, Muslim civil society and community leaders,   diplomats from Muslim countries and senior US officials usually   attend the State Department Ramadan event, a symbol of the US   government\\u2019s diplomatic efforts with Muslim countries and people. \\u201d \\u2019   If Tillerson avoids hosting one this year, that could send a   message \\u201dthat it is not as important to this administration to   engage with Muslims,\\u201d said former US diplomat Farah Pandith, who   served in the Bush and Obama administrations and helped plan   Ramadan events at the White House and State Department. \\u2019 \\u2019   Tillerson issued a statement on Friday to mark the start of   Ramadan, which he called \\u201da month of reverence, generosity, and    .\\u201d \\u2019 \\u2019   \\u201dMost importantly, it is a cherished time for family and friends   to gather and give charity to those who are less   fortunate,\\u201d he said. \\u2019 \\u2019  \\u2019 \\u201d   Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright started the   tradition 18 years ago of America\\u2019s top diplomat hosting a public   event for Ramadan, a lunar month. \\u201d \\u2019   The secretary of state of the time usually gives remarks there on   the meaning of Ramadan. \\u2019 \\u2019   In April, the State Department\\u2019\\u2019s Office of Religion and Global   Affairs made a request to Tillerson\\u2019\\u2019s office that he deliver   remarks at an Eid   reception this year, and suggested a     range of dates in July. The event would serve to   \\u201dhighlight State Department initiatives and the importance of   Muslim engagement,\\u201d the memo said. \\u2019 \\u2019   It noted that by hosting a reception just after Ramadan, rather   than an iftar   an often sumptuous dinner at sunset   a State   Department event could be held any time of the day, thus   preventing \\u201da very late evening for the Secretary.\\u201d \\u2019 \\u2019   Several weeks later, that office and other offices at the State   Department were alerted that Tillerson declined the request, the   officials said. \\u2019 \\u201d   Reuters was told of the request being declined but did not see   Tillerson\\u2019s reply. An official with the Office of Religion and   Global Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. \\u201d \\u2019   Several prominent   groups in the Washington area   who are normally invited to the Ramadan event told Reuters this   week that they had yet to receive an invitation from the State   Department, which they said was unusual. \\u2019 \\u2019     \\u201dIf they\\u2019\\u2019re having one, we haven\\u2019\\u2019t been invited,\\u201d said Rabiah     Ahmed, spokeswoman for the Muslim Public Affairs Council in     Washington. A representative for her group has been invited to     the State Department event in the past, she said.   \\u2019 \\u2019  \\u2019 \\u2019     Trump\\u2019\\u2019s administration has had a fraught relationship with     Muslims. As a presidential candidate, the Republican urged a     temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, called for     more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical Muslims     were \\u201dtrying to take over our children.\\u201d   \\u2019 \\u2019     Trump has since toned down his rhetoric and courts have halted     his temporary travel ban on people from six mostly Muslim     countries.   \\u2019 \\u2019     White House officials did not respond to a request for comment     on whether they would continue the tradition this year of     hosting a   event at the White House.   \\u2019 \\u201d     The State Department celebrates other religious traditions     though some of those commemorations are not as       as the State Department\\u2019s Ramadan event. In 2014,       of state John Kerry hosted the first ever     celebration at the State Department marking Diwali, the Hindu     festival.   \\u201d \\u2019     The White House also traditionally hosts annual Christmas and     Easter events as well as a Seder dinner to mark the Jewish     Passover.   \\u2019 \\u201d     The top US diplomat has personally hosted a Ramadan event every     year since 1999, often in the State Department\\u2019s grand Benjamin     Franklin room, apart from three years.   \\u201d \\u2019     In 2006 and 2015, deputies of the secretary of state at the     time hosted either an iftar dinner or an Eid   reception.

None of the threats proved real in the latest wave of intimidating acts targeting the Jewish community.  For some centers, though, it was not their first ordeal. The Louis S. Wolk Jewish Community Center in Rochester, New York, was evacuated Sunday morning for the second time in less than a week.  The center was hosting a \\u201dwarming center\\u201d for people whose homes had lost power when the bomb threat came, Executive Director Arnie Sohinki said.  It reopened without incident a few hours later after receiving an   from law enforcement, Sohinki said. he would not provide further details, citing the police investigation. \\u201dWe are open. We will remain open. Whoever is doing this doesn\\u2019t realize this only makes us #stronger, \\u201d the center said in a Facebook post. \\u201dAll are welcome to join us at the JCC.\\u201d Threats in the US and Canada, The Rochester JCC was one of several Jewish institutions to receive a bomb threat on Sunday. The threats coincided with the Jewish holiday of Purim, a festive commemoration of the defeat of a plot to exterminate Jews in ancient Persia.  Other locations reporting similar threats included Indianapolis Jewish Community Center in Indiana the Jewish Community Center of Greater Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada and The Harry  Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. All reopened a few hours later without incident. The Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center of Houston also received a bomb threat    its second in three weeks, Executive Vice President Joel Dinkin said. The center, which received the threat via email, was not evacuated.  The threats were the latest acts in a recent wave of   incidents across the United States. Museums, houses of worship, advocacy groups and cemeteries have been targets of bomb threats and vandalism as federal officials work with state and local authorities to find those responsible.  One person has been arrested in connection with a small portion of the calls. The head of police intelligence for New York City said he believes one person is responsible for most of the nationwide calls and the rest are the work of copycats. CNN was unable to confirm or corroborate his theory. Meanwhile, law enforcement officials have said they believe many of the threatening calls originated overseas. Sunday\\u2019s incidents bring the number of threats since January in the United States and Canada to 154, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. FBI investigation continues  The Louis S. Wolk JCC also received a bomb threat on Tuesday, March 7, the same day another center in Syracuse and the   League\\u2019s New York City headquarters received threats. No devices were found at the locations and the centers reopened soon after.  After the first bomb threat, the Rochester center had opened its doors to those who lost power in a winter storm blanketing the Northeast. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the bomb threat \\u201ddespicable\\u201d given the center\\u2019s service to the community. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the incident \\u201dcowardly,\\u201d especially on a holiday weekend celebrating \\u201dthe resiliency of the Jewish people.\\u201d \\u201dLike all New Yorkers, I am profoundly disturbed and disgusted by the continued threats against the Jewish community in New York. As New Yorkers, we will not be intimidated and we will not stand by silently as some seek to sow hate and division. New York is one family, and an attack on one is an attack on all,\\u201d he said in a statement. Cuomo said he would direct state police to investigate the bomb threats in conjunction with federal officials. Last week, Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio increased a reward for information on hate crimes    not just bomb threats    to $20, 000.  The FBI and the Justice Department\\u2019s Civil Rights Division vowed to investigate possible civil rights violations in connection with the threats. \\u201dThe FBI will collect all available facts and evidence, and will ensure this matter is investigated in a fair, thorough, and impartial manner. As this matter is ongoing, we are not able to comment further at this time,\\u201d the federal agency said.\"}, {\"guid\": 43543, \"content\": \"The first reported case of a person with measles in the recent Memphis outbreak, which now numbers seven confirmed cases, was at a local mosque on April 15, according to the Shelby County Health Department. [\\u201cThe first public place where there was a public exposure potentially [to measles] was the Masjid   Mosque on April 15,\\u201d Dr. Alisa Haushalter, Director of the Shelby County Health Department, tells Breitbart News.  \\u201cThe mosque is one location we know that individuals who were infectious were during their infectious period, but that\\u2019s not necessarily where the first case occurred. I don\\u2019t want you to draw conclusions without sufficient information,\\u201d she added. Haushalter acknowledged, however, that the measles outbreak could have originated with an unvaccinated for measles adult or child brought to Tennessee under the federal refugee resettlement program, something she called \\u201ca possibility amongst many. \\u201d There had been no reported cases of measles in Shelby County for the previous 24 months, according to a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health. \\u201cThere have been nine previous cases of measles in the entire state of Tennessee in the past 12 years,\\u201d WREG reported. The Shelby County Health Department first notified the public of a measles outbreak on Friday morning, April 22, reporting two confirmed cases, an adult and a child. \\u201cWe take the testing [of patients for measles] to the state lab then to CDC. We went public as soon as we received the confirmation,\\u201d spokesperson Elizabeth Hart tells Breitbart News. As of May 10, the number of reported cases of measles in Memphis has increased to seven. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) the number of measles cases in the United States grew from 63 in 2010 to 667 in 2014. It fell to 189 in 2015. That year, \\u201cthe United States experienced a large,   measles outbreak linked to an amusement park in California. The outbreak likely started from a traveler who became infected overseas with measles, then visited the amusement park while infectious however, no source was identified. \\u201d Surprisingly, the majority of the more than 70, 000 refugees resettled annually across the United States  through the federal refugee resettlement program are not required to have been vaccinated for measles prior to their arrival here. \\u201cRefugees being resettled in the United States, unlike immigrants seeking residency, have not been subject to immunization requirements,\\u201d according to a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) released by the CDC in January 2015. Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, tells Breitbart News, \\u201cI think you may not be reading the full MMWR, which does discuss a program that CDC set up that requires refugees from some countries to be vaccinated. \\u201d Refugees settled in the United States under the refugee resettlement program arriving from all but six countries  \\u2014   Thailand, Nepal, Malaysia, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Uganda  \\u2014   are not required to demonstrate they have received immunizations, specifically including measles, according to that January 2015 MMWR from the CDC. Of the 1, 601 refugees resettled in Tennessee in fiscal year 2015, 186 were resettled in Memphis, according to a report provided by Catholic Charities of Tennessee, which administers the program in the Volunteer State on behalf of the federal government under the   alternative program. Less than one percent of those 1, 601 refugees (a total of twelve individuals) were from the six countries (Thailand, Nepal, Uganda, Kenya, Malaysia, and Ethiopia) where refugees are required to be vaccinated for measles as a condition of their entry to the United States. Of the refugees resettled in Tennessee by Catholic Charities of Tennessee under the federal refugee resettlement program, 1, 589 (99 percent) came from countries of origin where the United States government does not require that refugees have measles vaccinations, including 332 from Iraq, 214 from Somalia, 206 from Congo, 393 from Burma, 138 from Bhutan, 57 from Sudan, 47 from Afghanistan, and 31 from Syria. Breitbart News contacted the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the part of the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for the federal refugee resettlement program, for comment several times over the past two weeks but has not received a response beyond the acknowledgement they had received our original inquiry. Michael Evans, State Refugee Health Coordinator for the Tennessee Office for Refugees, part of Catholic Charities of Tennessee, the VOLAG (voluntary agency) hired by ORR to operate the federal refugee resettlement program in Tennessee, did however respond to Breitbart News. \\u201cThe Tennessee Office for Refugees has not been contacted by the Shelby County Health Department, and has no information beyond what is publicly available through reputable news sources,\\u201d Evans tells Breitbart News. This seems to be a rather curious oversight by the Shelby County Health Department, given that the first instance of potential exposure occurred at a mosque in Memphis likely to be frequented by refugees resettled by Catholic Charities. Evans did not deny that the vast majority of refugees resettled in Tennessee by Catholic Charities of Tennessee are not required to be vaccinated for measles prior to their arrival in the United States. He did, however, offer this statement: I am happy to confirm that a refugee suffering from a measles infection would not be permitted to travel to Tennessee, and our screening program has not detected a person infected with measles. As indicated in the link you provided (and also found here) a majority of refugees begin or complete their MMR series before setting foot on a plane to the U. S. Once in Tennessee, medical providers review the vaccinations that were administered overseas to determine what series need to be completed here. Additionally, in order for a refugee to adjust their status to permanent resident (a step required of all refugees) the refugee must be vaccinated against measles, as required by U. S. immigration law. The Tennessee Office for Refugees \\u2014  through the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement \\u2014  provides access to all immunizations required to adjust status. The Tennessee Department of Health has been reluctant to provide details on the point of origin of the measles outbreak. \\u201cDue to the small number of individuals confirmed with measles in one county, our HIPAA Compliance Office has determined we may not provide any information at this time that could be used to identify an individual. We take our obligation to protect individuals  \\u2014   and to protect population health  \\u2014   most seriously,\\u201d Woody McMillen, director of communication and media relations for the Tennessee Department of Health, tells Breitbart News. According to the Shelby County Health Department, the first visit of a person infected with measles who may have spread the disease to others came at the     between the hours of 5:30 am and 8:30 am on Friday, April 15. The Masjid   Mosque offers \\u201cAdult Quran Class\\u201d every morning after \\u201cFajr,\\u201d the first of five daily prayers offered by Muslims, according to the mosque\\u2019s website. On April 15, those classes would likely have begun shortly after 5:00 am. Breitbart News contacted the Masjid   Mosque for comment, but has not received a response. The second visit of a person infected with measles came at the same location during the same three morning hours the following day, Saturday, April 16. By Sunday, persons infected with measles visited two additional locations, the nursery at the Collierville United Methodist Church, which is only open on Sundays from 8:15 am to noon, and a Goodwill store located in Millington, Tennessee. \\u201cFrom my knowledge it was detected at a local doctor\\u2019s office. They caught it early on it was an adult, a woman [who was infected with measles]   \\u2026    . No one else from my knowledge who was infected visited our store. I was not here when she [the woman infected with measles] came in [to the store on Sunday morning],\\u201d Ashley Brooks, the manager of the Goodwill store in Millington tells Breitbart News. According to the Shelby County Health Department: The investigation of the measles outbreak in Shelby County has identified the following locations as sites visited by people with measles during the time when they were infected with measles and could have spread the illness to others.

The original two cases involved an adult, and the other a child. Four of the cases were connected to each other. Two other cases were connected to each other. The possibility that immigrants brought to the United States under the federal refugee resettlement program pose a potential health risk to the rest of the population is one of a number of objections raised to the continuation of the program. Other objections include the unfunded mandate financial burden social welfare benefits impose upon states where the refugees are resettled, as well as security concerns that the resettled refugees, many of whom are Muslim, may pose due to possible ties to Islamist terrorist groups or ideologies. The prevalence of communicable disease among refugee populations is well documented. In January 2016, for instance, a severe outbreak of measles occurred in a refugee camp in Calais, France. In April, the Tennessee General Assembly declared its intention to sue the federal government over its operation of the refugee resettlement program on Tenth Amendment grounds.\"}, {\"guid\": 34703, \"content\": \"Maryland\\u2019s Howard County Board of Education has unanimously voted to add Muslim, Hindu, and Asian holidays as days in which students will be off.

We see that reflected in the Howard County Board of Education\\u2019s decision. \\u201d  CAIR is an unindicted   in the Holy Land Foundation terror financing trial, and a designated terror organization in the United Arab Emirates. \\u201cI am extremely pleased by the Board\\u2019s ability to discuss and unanimously agree to seek ways to recognize the diverse backgrounds of Howard County\\u2019s students and families,\\u201d said board of education chairwoman Christine O\\u2019Connor. \\u201cWe want to do our best to find flexibility within the calendar to provide opportunities for all students to experience all cultures within our community. \\u201d The Baltimore Sun reports the school district has always closed schools on   holidays and on the Jewish holidays of Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. However, a recent proposal to keep schools open on the Jewish holidays and only allow school closures for those mandated by the state evoked significant public attention in December. Several board members argued the county should be more inclusive of the religious beliefs and traditions of    students. \\u201cI strongly believe that our school calendar should be inclusive of the cultures and religions of all Howard County residents,\\u201d said board member Janet Siddiqui. \\u201cI moved here thirty years ago, because of the schools, but more because of the diversity. In a county where we pride ourselves on our diversity, we have to demonstrate that in terms of our actions. \\u201d Muslim, Asian and Hindu community members have reportedly encouraged the inclusion of their religious holidays for several years. In January of 2015, CAIR\\u2019s Chaudry expressed dismay that  \\u2014   in response to efforts to add a Muslim holiday to the school calendar  \\u2014   Howard County had proposed simply eliminating the names of all religious holidays on the calendar, and listing them instead in a side box. \\u201cThis wasn\\u2019t quite what we hoped for,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe were not seeking removal of references to existing religious holidays, even if they will be added in a box on the side of the calendar. We were simply requesting that the board include the Muslim holiday on the   calendar along with the Jewish holiday that will take place on the same day. \\u201d The current proposal\\u2019s approval will give Howard County students days off on Lunar New Year Eve, the Hindu holiday of Diwali, and the Muslim religious observance Eid    \\u2014   either through school closings or teacher professional development days. Schools will continue to be closed on Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. Though both the county school board\\u2019s vice chairwoman Ellen Flynn Giles and board member Sandie French voted for the proposal, they raised concerns about adding school holidays without first collecting pertinent data and establishing a system for evaluating similar proposals. Giles said she foresees even more requests for school holidays from other groups. \\u201cWe will find it very hard to manage that as more requests come forward,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe owe it to the community to establish a process by which we say, this is what we\\u2019re going to do. \\u201d French cited the separation between church and state as the reason why holidays can only be given to students for logistical  \\u2014   and not religious  \\u2014   reasons. \\u201cWhat I need to know is at what point, at what percentage of student absenteeism, is there a negative impact on our school system and therefore requires us to close schools for everyone,\\u201d French said. \\u201cWhat is that tipping point? And it\\u2019s changing. I think that we need to be more informed right now. \\u201d In other Maryland counties, school boards have apparently attempted to appease Muslim parents who have complained the districts recognize major Christian and Jewish holidays but not those of the Muslim religion. Montgomery County recently voted to give students a day off through a professional development day for teachers on Eid   though its school district calendar does not mention the names of any religious holidays. Similarly, in Fairfax County, the school district calendar does not mention religious holidays, but students have days off for \\u201cWinter Break\\u201d and \\u201cSpring Break. \\u201d Schools in Anne Arundel County, however, scheduled classes on Rosh Hashanah in the coming academic year due to a need for more instruction time. \\u201cThese groups aren\\u2019t asking for an unreasonable amount of days off,\\u201d added Rachel Lin, the Howard County school board\\u2019s student member. \\u201cThey just want one day to celebrate their family\\u2019s traditions. With the amount of schoolwork that students are getting in their classes, it\\u2019s difficult for students to want to miss a day of school. They might lose their traditions, because they are not able to celebrate. \\u201d According to the news report, while the school district says it does not record the religious affiliations of its students, as of the   school year, 42 percent of Howard County students were white, 22 percent were black, 19 percent were Asian, 9 percent were Hispanic and 6 percent were of two or more races. Board member Bess Altwerger said about the decision, \\u201cIf people considered for a minute what it would be like to have to take a major exam or hand in a major project the day after Christmas, maybe you can begin to understand how difficult that would be for people who celebrate alternative holidays. \\u201d \\u201cSchool is a place to foster   children who are proud of who they are, where they come from,\\u201d said Jean Xu, president of the Chinese American Parents Association. \\u201cSchool is also a place to raise future citizens who will contribute to this country as   when they grow up.

Commissioner Tafari Anderson observed it is difficult to close schools for all the holidays of every religious group individually, and proposed a designated week commemorating the various faiths as an alternative. With an unknown number of snow days to consider, as more school closure holidays are added to the calendar, graduation dates are moving further toward the month of July.

Facts:Celebrated on the first day of May. A holiday celebrating spring   working people. It is also often used as a day of civil protest.  History: The origins of May Day may go back to Pagan earth worship or to the spring festivals of ancient Egypt and India. Another theory ties the holiday to the Roman festival of Floralia, a festival that honored Flora, the goddess of springtime. As Rome conquered other countries, the tradition spread. Puritans in the United Stated looked down on May Day. As a result, the holiday is not celebrated as extensively in the United States. In Medieval England, May Day celebrations centered on the maypole, which is a pole made from wood, decorated with streamers, which are held by dancers circling the pole. In May of 1886, activists in the United States organized a national strike to promote an   workday. One of the protests, in Chicago\\u2019s Haymarket Square, turned violent, with days of clashes between police and demonstrators. The incident came to be known as the Haymarket Affair.  To honor those who participated in the Haymarket protest, the International Socialist Conference declared that May 1 would be a day designated for labor, called International Workers\\u2019 Day. The holiday was established at a meeting in 1889.  In the United States, Labor Day is celebrated on the first Monday in September.

[The first anniversary of the attack is Dec. 2.  Syed Rizwan Farook brought Pakistani woman Tashfeen Malik to the United States on a   finance visa in July 2014 and married her. Not a     later, the two shot and killed 14, and injured 22, at the holiday party on December 2, 2015. The FBI and police investigation into the massacre brought to light emails from Malik. Those emails revealed her disdain for the party\\u2019s Christmas setting, which was planned for the holiday luncheon put on by her husband\\u2019s employer. The holiday luncheon was set to follow a work training that Farook was being required to attend according to ABC News. San Bernardino police chief Jarrod Burguan told the media outlet, \\u201cShe had essentially made the statement in an online account that she didn\\u2019t think that a Muslim should have to participate in a   holiday or event. \\u201d Burguan called this one of very, very few pieces of evidence that point to a probable motive for the attack. Evidence surfaced within days of the attack that the two had been planning some form of assault for around a year. The investigation also revealed that Farook had practiced shooting at a firing range just two days before the attack. Burguan told ABC News that the two had high powered weaponry, lots of ammunition and \\u201cbombs at their disposal. \\u201d Following the attack, the Islamic terrorist couple stayed close to, and repeatedly drove by, the attack site for over four hours. It is now believed that they tried repeatedly to detonate three pipe bombs that they had planted in the building. Ultimately, the two were killed in a shootout with law enforcement. A remote detonator was found in the vehicle in which the two made their last stand. Farook had planned a maximum casualty Islamic terror attack years earlier, around 2012, with friend and Muslim convert Enrique Marquez. The two ultimately abandoned their plans in light of terror arrests at the time. Marquez has been charged as a straw purchaser of two rifles he provided to the terrorists that were used in the attack. Marquez has also been charged with marriage fraud. (He married a Russian woman in 2014 and the Russian woman\\u2019s sister married Farook\\u2019s brother.) Though investigators are placing blame on the holiday party, evidence shows that the couple had been stockpiling weaponry. One mystery that haunted authorities from early on was the presence of unused bombs found in the couple\\u2019s apartment after the attack was over and the married couple were dead. Farook had taken out life insurance policies in 2012, the year Marquez and Farook had been planning an attack, and in 2013. The life insurance proceeds total a combined $275, 000 in coverage. Court filings in the case for the federal government to seize the insurance funds cite the early terror plot plans of Farook and Marquez. Breitbart News previously reported, \\u201cDocuments also detailed Farook\\u2019s discussions of   linked Islamic terrorist Anwar   (listed in the documents as  ) and alleges that Farook and Marquez were \\u201cinspired by the acts of Muslim Army Major Nidal Hasan, who shot and killed 13 people and injured more than 30 at Fort Hood, Texas on November 5, 2009. \\u201d\\u201d Farook attended the Dar Al Uloom Islamiyah mosque, which has been tied to the fundamentalist Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) sect of Islam.

The person responsible for many of the threats, law enforcement officials said, was half a world away, in Israel, a Jewish teenager. An intensive investigation spanning multiple countries culminated on Thursday in the arrest of the    suspect, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, and his father. The teenager\\u2019s lawyer said he had a brain tumor that could affect his behavior. The surge in threats over the past few months  \\u2014   well over 100 sent to Jewish community centers, schools and museums since the start of the year  \\u2014   coincided with an increase in hate crimes against a number of groups, from scrawled swastikas to homicides, feeding worries about a new era of bigotry. American and Israeli officials refused to say how many of those threats the suspect was accused of making. And some recent   acts were apparently committed by others, like threats against Jewish centers for which a Missouri man was charged, and the vandalizing of Jewish cemeteries. But officials made it clear that they considered the teenager, who lived in the Ashkelon area of southern Israel, to be the primary source of the threats, though they did not offer a motive. \\u201cThis is the guy we are talking about,\\u201d an Israeli police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said. The suspect made threats to sites in Australia and New Zealand, as well as in the United States, and to at least one commercial airline flight, prompting an emergency landing, Mr. Rosenfeld said. A judge ordered the suspect, who has not been charged, held until at least March 30 and ordered a medical examination. His father was ordered held for eight days, on suspicion that he might have been aware of the threats, or even been involved. The father denies any knowledge of the threats, his lawyer said. The judge imposed an order of silence forbidding the Israeli authorities to release either man\\u2019s name. The teenager, who was born in Israel, has a brain tumor that can affect his cognitive abilities and lead to \\u201cirrational\\u201d behavior, his lawyer, Galit Bash, said. She would not say whether her client, who she said did not have a criminal record, had admitted or denied involvement. Ms. Bash and the father\\u2019s lawyer, Eran Rau, who are both from the Office of the Israeli Public Defender, said the young man was an only child who lived with his parents and had been   which is unusual in Israel. While most Israelis are drafted into military service, the teenager was rejected, which Ms. Bash said was because of his medical condition. Israeli news media reported that she had said in court that he had the tumor since he was 14. The father, an engineer in his early 50s, was cooperating with investigators, Mr. Rau said. He said his client, who also has no criminal record, was concerned primarily with his son\\u2019s welfare, given his medical condition. \\u201cThis all seems very strange and preliminary to me,\\u201d Mr. Rau said. Israeli news outlets reported that when the teenager was arrested, he tried to grab an officer\\u2019s gun. In his brief court appearance, the suspect, wearing khaki cargo pants, bowed his head and pulled up his shirt to conceal his face. On Thursday morning, after months of investigation and waves of turmoil and panic, the Federal Bureau of Investigation held a conference call with leaders of Jewish organizations to discuss the surprising denouement to the investigation. As the news spread, it drew mixed reactions from Jewish leaders and   groups who tried to make sense of it. Joel Dinkin, the executive vice president of the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center of Houston, said that it was \\u201ca little bit perplexing from the standpoint of the fact that it\\u2019s somebody Jewish. \\u201d Jonathan A. Greenblatt, chief executive of the   League, cautioned that many of the people responsible for   threats, vandalism and \\u201ca torrent of abuse online\\u201d remained at large. And even the threats attributed to the Israeli teenager, he said, should still be considered acts of  . \\u201cThe motive may have been unclear, but the impact was crystal clear,\\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said. \\u201cThese were acts that terrorized a community just because of their faith. \\u201d Critics of President Trump have accused him of playing down hatred and violence against minority groups and charged that his   remarks are fueling conflict. He did not publicly condemn the   threats and vandalism until Feb. 21, weeks after Jewish groups began calling on him to speak out. On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Mr. Trump suggested that some of the threats and vandalism could be a politically motivated effort to \\u201cmake people look bad,\\u201d rather than actual expressions of bias, according to people who took part in the meeting. Despite the arrest, \\u201cwe hope our elected officials will directly confront the wave of hate violence that we\\u2019ve seen since the election,\\u201d said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project. The authorities said the person who made the calls had sent them through the internet and used sophisticated software to disguise his location and camouflage his voice, which slowed the investigation. When the Israeli police searched the suspect\\u2019s house, investigators confiscated computers, an antenna and other equipment. An American official said it appeared that the man had used Tor, widely available anonymity software that masks a computer\\u2019s true whereabouts by routing its internet traffic through various points around the globe. Many people use Tor, which is managed by a nonprofit digital privacy group, including those conducting illicit business and activists trying to avoid government censorship or surveillance. \\u201cThe investigation began in several countries at the same time, in which dozens of threatening calls were received at public places, events, synagogues and community buildings that caused panic and disrupted events and activities in various organizations,\\u201d the Israeli police said in a statement. The F. B. I. worked closely with the Israeli authorities on the investigation, starting in September  \\u2014   months before American organizations began to note a surge in threats to American targets, according to Cary Gleicher, the bureau\\u2019s top agent in Israel. Some of the earliest American targets of bomb threats were schools, centers and museums in Alaska, Florida and New York that were affiliated with   an Orthodox Jewish movement, according to a Chabad official. The movement did not publicize the threats, which received little or no news coverage. Mr. Gleicher said he had met in early March in Washington with James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, who asked about efforts to find the person making the threatening calls, and made it clear that he had \\u201cgreat interest in getting this thing done. \\u201d In   Mr. Comey met with Jewish leaders at bureau headquarters to brief them on the investigation. \\u201cI left with a level of confidence that they were definitively making strides,\\u201d said Jerry B. Silverman, the chief executive of the Jewish Federations of North America. \\u201cIt was clear that they were moving at a very rapid pace. \\u201d The   cooperation intensified last week, when the F. B. I. sent 14 people  \\u2014   both agents and technical experts  \\u2014   to Israel to assist in the investigation, Mr. Gleicher said in an interview from Israel. \\u201cThis was a big deal,\\u201d he said, adding that it had taken the resources of both countries to get \\u201cacross the finish line. \\u201d \\u201cMonday was the eureka moment,\\u201d he said, when investigators figured out who was making the calls. In a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who described the threats as \\u201chate crimes,\\u201d said, \\u201cThe Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs. \\u201d\"}, {\"guid\": 20803, \"content\": \"The United Arab Emirates warned its citizens on Sunday to avoid wearing traditional clothing when traveling abroad, apparently in response to an episode in Ohio last week in which a businessman from Abu Dhabi, dressed in robes and a head scarf, was confronted by the police at gunpoint because a hotel clerk thought he might be a terrorist. The businessman was identified as Ahmed   41, by the Cleveland chapter of the Council on   Relations. Relatives of a front desk clerk at the Fairfield Inn and Suites in Avon, Ohio, called 911 on Wednesday to report that the clerk had panicked after seeing a man in robes and \\u201cfull head dress\\u201d in the hotel lobby, speaking on a phone and \\u201cpledging his allegiance or something to ISIS. \\u201d Officers rushed Mr. Menhali outside the hotel with guns drawn, pinned him to the ground, handcuffed him, searched his clothes and wallet, and took off his shoes to check his feet. Police   video of the encounter shows Mr. Menhali, who appeared to speak limited English, saying: \\u201cWhat is this?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m tourist,\\u201d and \\u201cNot good,\\u201d while he was on the ground. The Avon Police Department released audio and video of the episode to the news media, and the recordings were uploaded to YouTube. About 10 minutes into the encounter, as the likelihood of any arrest appeared to dissipate and Mr. Menhali was allowed to stand up, he collapsed on the pavement. An ambulance took him to St. John\\u2019s Medical Center, the police said local news reports said he had been treated for minor injuries and released. The warning from the Emirates government coincided with heightened security alerts in cities around the world after deadly terrorist attacks in Iraq, Bangladesh and Turkey further raised fears about the global reach of terrorism. The Ohio episode, however, raised questions about the intense police response to a report of a man in Middle Eastern dress standing in a hotel lobby, speaking on a cellphone. The Avon Police Department said in a statement that no weapon was found on Mr. Menhali. The police said after officers interviewed the hotel clerk, they concluded there had been a \\u201cclear miscommunication\\u201d with her relatives, and that Mr. Menhali had not made \\u201cany statements related to ISIS. \\u201d The police said the episode was being investigated, and the findings would be forwarded to the prosecutor\\u2019s office for review. Julia A. Shearson, the executive director of the Cleveland chapter of the Council on   Relations, said in an interview Sunday: \\u201cIt is shocking this happened. The bottom line is we understand the American people are on edge, and there\\u2019s definitely violence in the world, but we\\u2019ve come to this brute level of giving in to our fears. \\u201d Ms. Shearson also told The Independent that the way the police referred to Mr. Menhali\\u2019s clothing in their report  \\u2014   \\u201cas a criminal indicator\\u201d  \\u2014   was \\u201cvery concerning. \\u201d In a statement Monday, Marriott International, which owns the Fairfield Inn and Suites, said that it \\u201cdeeply regret\\u201d what happened to Mr. Menhali. The company said it planned to discuss with the hotel \\u201cdiversity and inclusion training designed to help prevent this type of situation. \\u201d Avon officials apologized to Mr. Menhali Saturday night at the council\\u2019s Cleveland office. The mayor, Bryan K. Jensen, told Mr. Menhali, \\u201cThere were some false accusations made against you, and those are regrettable. \\u201d The chief of the Avon police, Richard Bosley, said, \\u201cYou should not have been put in that situation like you were. \\u201d The United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement on Tuesday that he had met with Mr. Jensen and had received his personal apology. In a phone interview on Sunday, Mr. Jensen described the episode as \\u201cfrustrating on our end\\u201d because \\u201cit could\\u2019ve been tragic. \\u201d \\u201cGuns were drawn,\\u201d the mayor said. \\u201cWhen you make a false accusation, you put that person\\u2019s life in danger. \\u201d Mr. Menhali, he added, \\u201cwas 100 percent innocent. \\u201d Mr. Jensen said he had no problem issuing the apology because he was reminded of being teased as a child because his father, Niels, who immigrated from Denmark, spoke little English. But his father worked hard, he said  \\u2014   just like the 20 to 30 Arabic families who live in Avon, which is about 20 miles west of Cleveland with a population of about 21, 000. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s important to the Muslim community and the rest of the world to know that we care and it\\u2019s not something that we take lightly,\\u201d he said. Mr. Menhali, speaking through an interpreter by phone Sunday, said that the apology from city officials was a \\u201cgood first step,\\u201d but that he still had questions about why something like this could happen. He said he was in Ohio because he was visiting the Cleveland Clinic for a medical procedure. He had been looking for a hotel room because the owner of the apartment where he was staying in Cleveland wanted to rent it out for the Republican National Convention. Mr. Menhali said he had ended up in Avon because hotel rooms in the city area were scarce. At first, when the police approached outside the hotel, he thought it was a training exercise. Then he became afraid, he said. Since the encounter, he said, he has been having bad dreams.

On its website, the ministry also told residents to abide by the dress codes of nations they visited, and to take note of the ban on wearing   veils in countries like France and Belgium. The ministry\\u2019s messages did not mention the episode in Ohio specifically. But Ibrahim Hooper, a national spokesman for the Council on   Relations, said on Sunday, \\u201cAs far as I know, it came out as a result of this incident. \\u201d The ministry said on its website that it had summoned Ethan Goldrich, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy, over the \\u201cill treatment\\u201d of Mr. Menhali. According to the police audio and video, the hotel clerk sent text messages to her sister saying she had seen a \\u201csuspicious male\\u201d in the lobby with \\u201cmultiple disposable phones\\u201d and was feeling panicky about it. The sister then called the police. The clerk\\u2019s father apparently also phoned the police, saying she was \\u201cterrified\\u201d and had locked herself in a bathroom. Police videos showed officers arriving at the hotel, drawing and cocking rifles. One officer could be heard saying, \\u201cThere he is!\\u201d Another officer shouted, \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d A man in a white robe could be seen kneeling on the pavement in front of the hotel. Officers performed a   search and went through his wallet, allowing paper to blow away in the wind. When Mr. Menhali complained about a possibly broken phone, an officer can be heard saying: \\u201cYeah? Well you\\u2019ve broken my nail. \\u201d But an officer searched for and retrieved one of Mr. Menhali\\u2019s cellphones, which had been tossed into the bushes. Mayor Jensen said of the police\\u2019s treatment of Mr. Menhali, \\u201cI think there were things we can probably learn from this. \\u201d Asked if there would be repercussions for the false accusations against Mr. Menhali, the mayor said: \\u201cSomething will come out of this. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019ll be just a warning. \\u201d\"}]}\n"
